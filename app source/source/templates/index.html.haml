        %h6 CPAP / BiPAP / AUTO CPAP TITRATION
        %p A CPAP/BIPAP system treats OSA by providing low pressure airflow to your airway. The air pressure holds the airway open, preventing the collapse of the palate and tongue over the air passages. This allows for normal breathing and uninterrupted sleep.
        %p CPAP is one continuous positive airway pressure while BIPAP consists of two pressures, one inspiratory and one expiratory. The benefit of the CPAP/BiPAP therapy are:
        %ul
          %li Restoration of normal sleep patterns
          %li Greater alertness and less daytime sleepiness
          %li Less anxiety and depression
          %li Improvements in work productivity
          %li Better concentration and memory
          %li Fewer morning headaches
